## Hello there! 👋

🎓 I'm Ešref Pivčić, currently in my fourth year as a Software Engineering student at the Faculty of Information Technologies.

💻 I've developed solid skills in .NET (especially ASP.NET Core APIs) and Angular. I've also explored Go (for REST APIs), React, PostgreSQL, and Docker.

🚀 Currently, I'm learning Flutter and further enhancing my skills in ASP.NET Core APIs. I'm actively seeking opportunities for internships and jobs to apply and expand my knowledge and skills.

😊 Let's connect and grow together! Explore my projects, and don't hesitate to get in touch.
