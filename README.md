## Hello there! 👋

🎓 I'm Ešref Pivčić, currently in my fourth year as a Software Engineering student at the Faculty of Information Technologies.

💻 My expertise lies in .NET (ASP.NET Core APIs) and Angular, but I'm also in the process of mastering Go (REST APIs), React, PostgreSQL, and Docker.

🚀 While I'm on my learning journey, I'm actively seeking opportunities for internships and jobs to apply and expand my knowledge and skills.

😊 Let's connect and grow together! Explore my projects, and don't hesitate to get in touch.
